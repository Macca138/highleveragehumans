# Favicon.ico Placeholder for High Leverage Humans

This file serves as a placeholder for the actual favicon.ico file.

To create the actual favicon.ico:
1. Design a premium icon representing "High Leverage Humans"
2. Use tools like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, or online favicon generators
3. Create multi-size ICO file (16x16, 32x32, 48x48)
4. Replace this placeholder with the actual binary ICO file

The favicon should represent:
- Premium/luxury positioning
- Trading/financial elements
- Growth/leverage concepts
- Professional appearance
- High contrast for small sizes

Recommended design elements:
- HLH monogram
- Upward arrow/leverage symbol
- Professional color scheme (#1a1a1a primary)
- Clean, modern aesthetic

Once created, rename the ICO file to "favicon.ico" and place in the root directory.
